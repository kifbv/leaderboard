## Codebase Patterns

**Prisma client import:** `import { prisma } from "../lib/prisma"` (relative from src/). The singleton is at `src/lib/prisma.ts`.
**Prisma model types:** `import type { Player } from "../generated/prisma/client"` (relative from src/).
**API routes:** Next.js App Router convention — `app/api/[route]/route.ts` with `export async function GET/POST(req)`.
**Prisma 7 seed config:** Seed command goes in `prisma.config.ts` under `migrations.seed`, NOT in `package.json`. Use `tsx prisma/seed.ts` with `tsx` installed as devDependency.
**Seed script pattern:** Import PrismaClient and adapter directly (not the lib/prisma singleton) — the singleton uses globalThis for hot-reload which doesn't apply in scripts.
**Tailwind v4:** CSS file uses `@import "tailwindcss"` (not the v3 directives). No `tailwind.config.ts` needed.
**ESLint immutability:** react-hooks/immutability rule flags `let` variable reassignment inside render scope. Use `reduce` instead of mutation inside `.map()` callbacks.
**Server components + data fetching:** Use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to prevent caching; query Prisma directly rather than making HTTP calls to API routes.

**Unit testing pattern:** `vitest run` with `npm test`. Tests live at `src/lib/*.test.ts`. No config file needed — vitest works out of the box for pure TS utility files.
**Route shadowing gotcha:** If a root-level `app/` directory exists alongside `src/app/`, Next.js App Router picks up `app/` at root first, silently ignoring `src/app/`. This manifests as all custom routes returning 404 with zero error output. Fix: remove the stale root `app/` directory.
**Interactive UI pattern:** Split into server component (page.tsx — fetches data from Prisma) + client component (XxxForm.tsx — handles state, events). Server component uses `select:` to minimize data sent to client.

# Ralph Progress Log

## 2026-02-11 - US-001
- Initialized Next.js 16 (App Router) with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Installed Prisma 7 with SQLite via `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3` driver adapter
- Created schema: Player, Match, MatchPlayer models with initial migration
- Created `src/lib/prisma.ts` singleton using PrismaBetterSqlite3 adapter
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Prisma 7 uses new `prisma-client` generator (not `prisma-client-js`), output goes to `src/generated/prisma/` with no index.ts — import from `../generated/prisma/client`
  - Prisma 7 requires a driver adapter for SQLite: `PrismaBetterSqlite3` from `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`
  - `PrismaClientOptions` requires either `adapter` or `accelerateUrl` — no direct connection option
  - `@/*` path alias maps to project root (not `src/`), so use relative imports inside `src/`
  - DATABASE_URL is `file:./dev.db` (relative to project root); db file lives at project root
  - `create-next-app` can't run in a non-empty directory — create in temp dir and copy files over
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-002
- Created `prisma/seed.ts` with 6 players (varying ELO 998–1320, wins, losses)
- Installed `tsx` as devDependency for running TypeScript seed scripts
- Configured seed command in `prisma.config.ts` under `migrations.seed`
- Added `prisma.seed` key to `package.json` (informational only; Prisma 7 reads from config)
- Verified: `npx prisma db seed` works; idempotent via `upsert`
- Files changed: `prisma/seed.ts`, `prisma.config.ts`, `package.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Prisma 7 reads seed command from `prisma.config.ts` → `migrations.seed`, not `package.json`
  - Use `tsx` (not `ts-node`) for TypeScript seed scripts — simpler, works with ESM
  - Seed scripts should create their own PrismaClient (not import the Next.js singleton) to avoid globalThis issues
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-004
- Created `src/app/globals.css` with Tailwind v4 `@import "tailwindcss"` directive
- Created `src/app/layout.tsx` — app shell with nav bar (Leaderboard title + "Log Match" link)
- Created `src/app/page.tsx` — server component fetching players directly from Prisma, computing rank (ties share rank) and winRate, showing table with rank/name/ELO/W/L/Win%; empty state "No players yet"
- Files changed: `src/app/globals.css`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tailwind v4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` in CSS (not `@tailwind base/components/utilities`)
  - ESLint react-hooks/immutability rule flags `let` reassignment inside render — use `reduce` instead of `let rank = 1` + `.map()` mutation
  - Next.js App Router server components should use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"` to opt out of caching when fetching data that changes per request
  - Server components can query Prisma directly — no need for an HTTP round-trip to the API route
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-005
- Created `src/lib/elo.ts` — pure `calculateElo(winnerRating, loserRating)` function returning `{ newWinnerRating, newLoserRating }`
- Installed `vitest` as devDependency; added `"test": "vitest run"` to package.json scripts
- Created `src/lib/elo.test.ts` with 3 tests: equal ratings (±16), underdog wins (±24), favorite wins (±8)
- All 3 tests pass; typecheck and lint pass
- Files changed: `src/lib/elo.ts`, `src/lib/elo.test.ts`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vitest works out of the box for pure TypeScript utility files — no config file needed
  - ELO formula: `expectedWinner = 1 / (1 + 10^((loserRating - winnerRating) / 400))`, delta = `K * (1 - expected)`, K=32
  - When equal (1000 vs 1000): delta = 16. Underdog wins (1000 beats 1200): delta = 24. Favorite wins (1200 beats 1000): delta = 8.
  - loserDelta = -(1 - expectedWinner) which simplifies correctly since expectedLoser = 1 - expectedWinner
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-003
- Created GET /api/leaderboard endpoint at `src/app/api/leaderboard/route.ts`
- Returns players sorted by eloRating desc with rank (ties share rank), winRate (computed, whole-number %)
- Files changed: `src/app/api/leaderboard/route.ts`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Rank ties: track `rank` as a separate variable that only advances when eloRating changes from previous player
  - winRate = 0 when wins + losses = 0 (avoid division by zero); use `Math.round()` for whole-number percentage
  - Next.js App Router API routes live at `src/app/api/[path]/route.ts`; no layout.tsx required for API-only routes to typecheck
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-006
- Created POST /api/matches endpoint at `src/app/api/matches/route.ts`
- Accepts `{ type: "SINGLES", winnerId: number, loserId: number }`
- Validates both player IDs exist and are distinct; returns 400 with descriptive message otherwise
- Uses Prisma transaction: creates Match + MatchPlayer records for winner/loser, updates eloRating/wins/losses atomically
- Returns 201 with matchId, type, winner/loser objects each containing id, name, oldRating, newRating, delta
- Files changed: `src/app/api/matches/route.ts`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => { ... })` for interactive transactions; nested create with `include` works inside transactions
  - Fetch both players with `findMany({ where: { id: { in: [id1, id2] } } })` to validate existence in a single query
  - MatchPlayer `role` field: "winner" / "loser" for singles; this extends naturally to doubles roles
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-007
- Extended POST /api/matches to handle `{ type: "DOUBLES", winnerTeam: [id, id], loserTeam: [id, id] }`
- Validates arrays of exactly 2 IDs each, all 4 IDs must be distinct numbers, all must exist in DB
- Team effective rating = average of two players' ratings; ELO delta computed from team averages
- Same delta applied uniformly: winners +delta, losers -delta (all 4 in one Prisma transaction)
- Creates Match + 4 MatchPlayer records (2 "winner", 2 "loser") atomically
- Returns 201 with matchId, type, winnerTeam/loserTeam arrays each with id, name, oldRating, newRating, delta
- Files changed: `src/app/api/matches/route.ts`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Avoid destructuring unused variables from calculateElo — ESLint no-unused-vars warns on them; only destructure what you use
  - `for...of` loop over player IDs for batch player updates inside a transaction is clean and avoids Promise.all complexity
  - Doubles delta = `newWinnerAvg - winnerAvg` (positive); losers get `-delta`; individual player new ratings = `oldRating + delta`
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-008
- Removed stale root `app/` directory (create-next-app boilerplate) that was shadowing `src/app/` — this was the root cause of all routes returning 404 silently
- Created `src/app/log-match/LogMatchForm.tsx` — client component with player dropdowns (sorted A-Z, disabled when already selected in other slot), winner buttons visible only when both players selected, ELO delta confirmation, form reset on success
- Created `src/app/log-match/page.tsx` — server component fetching players from Prisma, rendering LogMatchForm
- All routes (/, /api/leaderboard, /api/matches, /log-match) now correctly appear in `npm run build` output as dynamic routes (ƒ)
- Files changed: deleted `app/*` (boilerplate), created `src/app/log-match/LogMatchForm.tsx`, `src/app/log-match/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Root `app/` vs `src/app/` conflict: Next.js silently picks root `app/` over `src/app/`. The server logs show compile+render times for unrecognized routes but still 404 — no error is logged. Fix: ensure no root `app/` directory exists.
  - Interactive pages: split into page.tsx (server, fetches data) + XxxForm.tsx (client, handles interaction). Pass minimal data with Prisma `select:`.
  - `disabled` on `<option>` prevents a player from being selected in the other dropdown without complex JS filtering
---

## 2026-02-11 - US-009
- Extended `src/app/log-match/LogMatchForm.tsx` with a Singles/Doubles toggle
- Doubles mode shows Team 1 (two player selects) and Team 2 (two player selects)
- Each select disables all IDs already chosen in any other slot — prevents any player appearing twice
- Winner buttons show team name + player names; success confirmation shows per-player ELO delta
- Form resets after successful submission; toggle resets form state on switch
- Extracted reusable `PlayerSelect` sub-component to avoid repeated select markup
- All quality checks pass (typecheck, lint, vitest, build)
- Files changed: `src/app/log-match/LogMatchForm.tsx`, `prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - For 4-slot deduplication, pass `disabledIds` as array to each select and check with `.includes(String(id))` — simpler than global filtering
  - TypeScript discriminated union (`type: "SINGLES" | "DOUBLES"`) enables narrowing result type in JSX without casts
  - `new Set(ids.filter(Boolean)).size === ids.length` is a clean distinctness check for arrays where some may be empty strings
